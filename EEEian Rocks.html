<h1>EEEian Rocks</h1>
<h2>Helping you to learn better</h2>
<h3> 		Objective for making this website</h3>
<p1> My objective is to create a free website which will help the freshers of Electrical Engineering of NSU students to learn the fundamentals of engineering with the help of an animation.My target is to make the monotonous subject lively so that students can visualize what is happening, which will enhance their interest in the subject.</p1>


<p2> Firstly, students will have to create a free account in this website by simply logging it through their Google gmail/NSU ID or by using the username of their social medias.Then different panels will arrive serially providing notes, quizzes, regular assignments and audio recordings for a particular topic.</p2>
<p3> Secondly, students of NSU, especially who are doing major in EEE will be the instructor for the courses, depending on the topic which they are eager to teach.The instructors are amiable to the students and explain every topic with dedication from the root with the help of the animated circuits/animations.</p3>
<p4> Thirdly,after the completion of the chapter, the instructor will throw a pop quiz(with a duration of 20 minutes) to the students to evaluate their understanding about that chapter.They will mark the papers immediately after everyone submits, pointing out the errors with proper explanations,so that the students can figure out their mistakes and can improve themselves in future quizzes.</p4>
<p5> Lastly, the students will be able to see their performance statistically(Both line graph and Bar chart,where bar chart compares the performance of every student and line graph shows the result of individual student) Each students will be able to point out where they are lacking and will improve based on their performance.On the other hand, the students will also be able to provide us with feedback on social platforms, like Facebook and Messenger.</p5>

<h4>             		Outcome of this website</h4>

<b6>Freshers will understand the topic in depth,which will help them in the advanced courses.
There will be continuous quizzes at the end of each session and continuous homeworks to boost up their memory.
If a student faces difficulty to understand the course materials, he/she can go through the audio recordings provided for individual chapters.
If an individual secures first position, he/she will be given a bunch of story books as their prize.
For those securing 2nd and 3rd position in the quizzes will be given one story book.
Students will earn the highest cgpa in all the courses.
At the end of week, bar chart will indicate the performance of the students compared to others and the line graph will indicate the performance of an individual student throughout the week.</b>
